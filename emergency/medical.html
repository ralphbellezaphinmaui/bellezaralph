        <h2>ðŸš‘Medical AttentionðŸš‘</h2>
        <div style="overflow: auto;">
            Dear Students, We hope this message finds you well. We would like to inform you that our school now has a medical clinic on the premises. This facility is here to provide immediate medical attention should you need it during school hours.
            In light of the recent extreme heat wave, we also want to remind everyone to take necessary precautions to stay safe and healthy:
            Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day, even if you donâ€™t feel thirsty.
            Avoid Direct Sunlight: Try to stay in shaded areas during peak sun hours (10 AM to 4 PM).
            Wear Appropriate Clothing: Light-colored, loose-fitting clothing can help keep your body cool.
            Use Sunscreen: If you must be outside, donâ€™t forget to apply sunscreen to protect your skin from harmful UV rays.
            Rest: Take breaks if youâ€™re feeling tired or dizzy. Overexertion can lead to heat exhaustion or heat stroke.
            Remember, the medical clinic is here for you. Donâ€™t hesitate to visit if youâ€™re feeling unwell. Letâ€™s look out for each other and stay safe in this heat.
